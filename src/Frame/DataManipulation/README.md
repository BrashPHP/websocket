# Data Manipulation

This directory describe functions to manipulate data in frame* representations.
Every function that is a direct result of constant input and output, with no necessity of retain state is described in Functions/ as a class compounded of a **single static method**.

Glossary:

- in this context, a "frame" is an assembly of bytes represented by a "byte-string" or a (signed) int.
